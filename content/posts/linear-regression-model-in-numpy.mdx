## Overview

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used predictive modeling techniques. In this post, we’ll learn how to build a linear regression model from scratch using NumPy, without relying on any machine learning libraries.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between an independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (target) using a straight line. The line is represented as:

**y = mx + b**

Where:
- `m` is the slope of the line.
- `b` is the y-intercept.
- `x` is the independent variable, and `y` is the dependent variable.

The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values by finding the best `m` and `b`.

```py
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Visualize the data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Synthetic Data for Linear Regression")
plt.show()
```
## Why Use Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm for predictive analytics with various applications:
	•	Healthcare: Estimating patient recovery times.
	•	Finance: Forecasting market trends.
	•	Engineering: Modeling performance metrics.
	•	Sales: Predicting revenue based on historical data.

By understanding this basic model, you can better appreciate its applications and build upon it with more complex algorithms.

Implementing Linear Regression in NumPy

Here’s how you can implement linear regression from scratch using NumPy:

### Step 1: Define the Cost Function

The cost function calculates the error between predicted and actual values. For linear regression, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE = (1/n) Σ (y_actual - y_predicted)²
```
# Define the cost function
def compute_cost(X, y, theta):
    m = len(y)
    predictions = X.dot(theta)
    cost = (1 / (2 * m)) * np.sum((predictions - y) ** 2)
    return cost
    ```
    ### Step 2: Implement Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function by iteratively updating theta:

θ = θ - (α/m) Σ (y_actual - y_predicted) * x
```
# Implement gradient descent
def gradient_descent(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters):
    m = len(y)
    cost_history = []

    for i in range(num_iters):
        predictions = X.dot(theta)
        errors = predictions - y
        theta -= (alpha / m) * (X.T.dot(errors))
        cost = compute_cost(X, y, theta)
        cost_history.append(cost)

    return theta, cost_history
    ```
    ### Step 3: Train the Model

Using synthetic data, train the linear regression model.
```# Predict using the model
X_new = np.array([[0], [2]])  # New data points
X_new_b = np.c_[np.ones((len(X_new), 1)), X_new]
y_predict = X_new_b.dot(theta)

# Plot predictions
plt.scatter(X, y, label="Data")
plt.plot(X_new, y_predict, color="red", label="Prediction")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Linear Regression Prediction")
plt.show()
```
## Why Build Linear Regression from Scratch?

Building linear regression from scratch helps you:
	•	Understand the mathematical foundations of machine learning.
	•	Develop a better intuition for optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
	•	Gain hands-on experience with numerical computing using NumPy.

## Advantages of Linear Regression
