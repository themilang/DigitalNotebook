This is a real-time chat application built with WebSockets and the Socket.IO library. It leverages a single TCP connection to establish bi-directional, low-latency communication between the server and clients. With **Node.js** on the server-side and **React** on the client-side, the application ensures high-frequency and efficient messaging capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant communication with no delays.
- **Bi-Directional Communication**: Both clients and the server can send and receive messages simultaneously.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and session handling.
- **Typing Indicators**: Real-time feedback for users while typing.
- **Room Support**: Join specific chat rooms for group or private discussions.
- **Scalability**: Efficient handling of multiple simultaneous connections.
- **Persistent Chat History**: Save and load chat history for ongoing conversations.

## Technologies

- **WebSockets**: Core technology for real-time, bi-directional communication.
- **Socket.IO**: Library for simplifying WebSocket communication and handling events.
- **Node.js**: Backend for handling server-side logic and WebSocket connections.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building APIs and routing.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for dynamic and responsive UI.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and chat history.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling a clean and responsive user interface.
